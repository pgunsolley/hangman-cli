# Hangman CLI

## A stupid hangman game

I wanted to take a break from my serious projects. So, here we are.
It needs tests, it was written quickly, and it works.

This is not a technical demonstration.
This is not a skill demonstration.
It is purposefully somewhat smelly in design.
It's just a stupid hangman game.

## Dependencies

Written for [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) v24.6.0

Run it directly with [Coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org) v2.7.0

```
coffee .
```

Or compile it and run it lol

Coffeescript is not a project dependency. 

You will need to run it with a task runner or install it globally

## Dev TODO

- Tests
- Actually define the dependencies in package.json lol

## 3rd Party APIs

Uses

- [random-word-api](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home)
- [api.dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/)
